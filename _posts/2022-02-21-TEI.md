## TEI of Bram Stoker's _Dracula's Guest_

#### Annotating
Before we started our coding project, each student was assinged a short passage out of _Dracula's Guest_ to read and and annotate in google docs on what parts of the passage would need to be coded in Oxygen.

My passage was fairly short, but as you can see by the amount of highlighted material it was going to require a decent amount of code. The Passage starts off with an incscirption, followed by a page break, and the next page included an em dash with another inscription as well as a couple of paragraphs. Once the annotation was complete it was time to begin the actual coding.

#### Coding XML

The first day we worked on coding the passage in Oxygen I took to twitter to express my initial experience. I had taken classes before that included coding but I would not consider myself anything close to a pro. There were a couple things that helped minimize my struggle with the project. For one, Oxygen already had a pre formatted code for the title and passage itself, so all I had to do was manually tpye in the title of the novel and the author manually without coding myself. Second, the resource in scholar that included how to code each potential feature in the passage was a a helpful resource. The code source on scholar allow for quick reference and prevented me from having to research how to code certain features on my own.

Being able to code in class also allowed for me to quickly fix any errors in my coding by using professor Stover as a resource. She was able to clarify to me what type of code the features in my passage were classified as, as well as teaching why one of my code's highlighted red.

#### Final Product

Above shown is what my code of the passage looks like in Oxygen. The passage starts towards the bottom under <text> and <body> and ends with the same text. Each piece of coded text is in between a word or character that is inside of angled brackets.
  
Overall, coding using XML in oxygen was a better experience than I thought it was going to be when the project was introduced. Thanks to the resources available in class and on scholar the learning curve was easy to overcome.

## TEI of Bram Stoker's _Dracula's Guest_

#### Annotating
Before we started our coding project, each student was assinged a short passage out of _Dracula's Guest_ to read and and annotate in google docs on what parts of the passage would need to be coded in Oxygen.

My passage was fairly short, but as you can see by the amount of highlighted material it was going to require a decent amount of code. The Passage starts off with an incscirption, followed by a page break, and the next page included an em dash with another inscription as well as a couple of paragraphs. Once the annotation was complete it was time to begin the actual coding.

The first day we worked on coding the passage in Oxygen I took to twitter to express my initial experience. I had taken classes before that included coding but I would not consider myself anything close to a pro.

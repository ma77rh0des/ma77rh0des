## Background
My name is Matt Rhodes and I am from Alexandria, VA. I am an accounting major in the Luter School of Business and am on track to graduate at the end of this semester. I found out late last week that I needed another writing intensive to graduate. I am currently in an auditing case study writing intensive, and wanted to take a class about something I have not learned about yet while at CNU. Digital humanities was perfect as it peaked my interest, and is not necessarily an essay heavy course.
## School Involvement
I chose to attend CNU over other schools for the intention of playing baseball. Once Coach Harvell offered me a spot on the roster during my senior year of high school, I applied early action to the school and did not apply to a single other college. I played on the varsity team here at school for the last 3 years, but due to injury this will be my first year not playing competitive baseball since I was 4.  

Despite being without baseball, I found my closest friends at school by rushing a Pike my freshman year. I became super involved with the fraternity throughout my time at school, and even served as president for the chapter in 2021.  

Another club that I am recently excited to become a part of is the surf club. The surf club was formed last year, and I joined as a member to carpool with fellow students to VA Beach and the Outer Banks. The club offers rides, cheap lessons, and board rentals for anyone, not just members.

### Background
My name is Matt Rhodes and I am from Alexandria, VA. I am an accounting major in the Luter School of Business and am on track to graduate at the end of this semester. I found out late last week that I needed another writing intensive to graduate. I am currently in an auditing case study writing intensive, and wanted to take a class about something I have not learned about yet while at CNU. Digital humanities was perfect as it peaked my interest, and is not necessarily an essay heavy course.
### School Involvement
I chose to attend CNU over other schools for the intention of playing baseball. Once Coach Harvell offered me a spot on the roster during my senior year of high school, I applied early action to the school and did not apply to a single other college. I played on the varsity team here at school for the last 3 years, but due to injury this will be my first year not playing competitive baseball since I was 4.  

Despite being without baseball, I found my closest friends at school by rushing a Pike my freshman year. I became super involved with the fraternity throughout my time at school, and even served as president for the chapter in 2021. While serving as president I was able to attend leadership conferences in Philadelphia, Memphis, and virrtually all while getting to meet current and previous leaders of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity from all over the country.  

Another club that I am recently excited to become a part of is the surf club. The surf club was formed last year, and I joined as a member to carpool with fellow students to VA Beach and the Outer Banks. The club offers rides, cheap lessons, and board rentals for anyone, not just members. This club has been a great experience meeting new people and enjoying doing what I love all while being able to get away from campus.
### Personal
My biggest personality trait is not a unique one, but I am an avid sports fan. I am a die hard Baltimore fan and commoner at both Camden Yards and M&T bank stadium. During football season, most of my social media profiles are headed by Lamar Jackson. For college sports I have become very invested in all things Oklahoma sooners, as my dad grew up in Norman and my little brother is now a freshman there. I belong to a family of 5 with a twenty pound cat who all cheer for the same team, and am the middle child of 3 boys. Outside of sports, my interests involve surfing, listening to music, working out, and hanging out with friends.

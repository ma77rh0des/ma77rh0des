## _Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan_ Review
This Digital Humanities Review is about a geographical timeline of the growth, decline, and spread of one of the eras of the Ku Kulx Klan in America. The timeline spans from 1915 to 1940 and allows the user to visualize the organization's growth scrolling through the years by displaying red dots on an exact location naming the specific "Klavern" group. A short description is provided in the link "About" picture below.

The purpose of this DH is for the user to be able to conceptualize how far and fast the Klan spread and grew into different Klaverns. As the user slides the yearly ticker at the point of the screen, red dots appear across the map. These individual dots can be interacted with as a simple click provides the individual Klavern's name, exact location, group number, and a rough date of foundation. Users can get a grasp of of the expansion of the second Klan as a whole, or dive deeper into a specific group by clicking on individual pinpoints. Below is pictured an area of the U.S on the DH displaying what the pinpoints look like on a map. Each location is interactive.

This project's data and information comes mostly from newspapers and primary documents such as letters sent and received by people in the area at the time to get as close to an exact formation date for each group. When clicked on, each pinpoint one or more citations for the source(s) used to confirm that group. There is also a hotlink under the source(s) that takes the user to a separate page that displays each source with some sources containing a short description about it. An example of one of the descriptions is under "Call of the North (Minneapolis):
> "The Call of the North was published in 1923-1924 at St. Paul, Minnesota. It advertised itself in the Indiana Fiery Cross of 14 December 1923, as “A Voice of Militant Protestantism.” The final issue appeared on 15 February 1924, with the announcement that the "Minnesota Fiery Cross, Official Klan Organ, Starts With Next Week's Issue." Microfilmed copies are held at the Minnesota Historical Society."
The usability of the project is very practical and self explanatory. Zooming in and out of the map is possible via the mousepad or with plus and minus clickers on the side. Exploring around the map in any direction is done by clicking and dragging away from the desired location. The slider under the map controls the year you are looking at where the active groups of Klansmen are. You can scroll through the slider to a desired date, or you can press the play/pause button to the left of the slider to watch the development of groups over time automatically rather than manually. The only critique is that the project uses a world map to navigate, yet the "Klaverns" are only documented and displayed in the US. There is wasted space when zoomed out and ability to get lost when zoomed in.
The project is a fun and pleasing visual display of the growth of the second Klan all over the country from 1915-1940. It is a great place to get started when researching general information on the Ku Klux Klan, or to find sources about individul Klaverns. There is a helpful "learn more" page available after clicking the "About" button on the home site that gives informational help on where its sources came from as well as about the map itself. However, one should not use this project to quote or cite when doing their own academic research. For one, the project admits their data is imperfect. The dates for each Klavern are not proven to be correct, they are only an estimation based on the sources used to make the timeline. There is no primary evidence or data on the project itself that can be considered valid for an academic paper. Despite the project's imperfect data, it is still a useful place to find out where to do one's own research as it is organized very well with each Klavern having its own source for one to research themself.

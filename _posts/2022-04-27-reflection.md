## Matt R

As an accounting major with zero background of using or studying digital humanities projects, I came into the class not knowing what to expect. I even joined the class a week late after discovering I needed another writing intensive to graduate. Missing this first week meant I joined the class post discussions about defining digital humanities, and in doing so I was left to learn about it along the way. Googling the term's definition my first week left me unsatisfied and still with little understanding of what digital humanities were, especially the humanities part.

#### Understanding DH

I looked at and analyzed what felt like close to 100 individual projects over the course of the class. One of the most important assignments that helped my understanding of the field was the review blog post. During the weeks leading up to its due date, we had to browse a bunch of different projects. Understanding what made the projects digital was easy but going through the variety of themes and purposes of the projects still confused me about what made some of them about humanities. The majority of the projects I looked at had to deal with human history in some way, yet some DH projects for example analyzed different species of mosquitoes in a country or even the difference in oceanic plates in the Pacific and Atlantic.

What really helped my understanding of the field was creating our own grant to receive a stipend from the school to make our own digital project. The more I looked at other projects to help find motivation for my own, the more I began to understand the purpose and themes of the other projects. I was finding it easier to see how each project tied in with the humanities once I started drafting up my grant. Humanities is such a vast subject and finding a way to tie my desired project idea back into the academic study was easy after the amount of browsing we had done in and out of class of other digital projects. 

#### Class Review

The pace of the class was great with very minimal times of feeling overwhelmed, especially with me taking 18 credits this semester. I do not say this meaning there was little work or that the class was easy in general. However, we were granted substantial time to work on our blogs or other assignments in class, use Dr. Stover as a resource not just in office hours, and receive plenty of feedback from fellow students. The time allotted for us to work in class helped me understand better our readings and assignments, especially due to the feedback from Dr. Stover and other students that I may not have reached out for outside of the class setting.

Along with the pace of the class, the layout of the schedule was easy to follow as not only each assignment but each individual reading for the rest of the semester was posted before class began. This allowed for me to better manage my time and also to get a better understanding of the direction the course was heading. There were not too many loaded content readings, and the readings were easy to keep up with. Each reading directly related to our next project even if the reading itself was not directly correlated to Digital Humanities, such as "Shitty First Drafts" before our first peer review. In fact, most of my favorite readings from the class were one not necessarily about our specific projects such as the Text Scanning Patterns reading, "Shitty First Drafts", and the gendered language in teacher reviews project.

After looking at so many DH projects throughout the semester and writing a grant for my own, one thing I would have liked to do in class would have been creating our own project from start to finish. Similar to the grant, it would have been cool to pick a topic or theme and go through the process of researching our topic as well as researching what programs we could use for it plus how to use said programs. After completing the research it would have been satisfying to bring our project to life with our chosen free to use program. I say all this without ever making one before and understanding the time that would need to be allocated to actually create the project, but it was just something I thought about while creating the grant.

Overall, I believe I have developed as a writer in more diverse ways than I have with any other writing course I have taken. In this class we were able to tweet, create blogs, code, and still complete academic writing projects. Below I have attached some forms of code I learned while taking this course that I wouldn't have learned in another English class.

Typically writing intensive courses have been essay heavy and I only improve in that form of academic writing. This class was satisfying as the projects and assignments varied and helped me improve in different subjects of writing, such as resume building.

## _Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan_ Review
This Digital Humanities Review is about a geographical timeline of the growth, decline, and spread of one of the eras of the Ku Kulx Klan in America. The timeline spans from 1915 to 1940 and allows the user to visualize the organization's growth scrolling through the years by displaying red dots on an exact location naming the specific "Klavern" group. A short description is provided in the link "About" picture below.

The purpose of this DH is for the user to be able to conceptualize how far and fast the Klan spread and grew into different Klaverns. As the user slides the yearly ticker at the point of the screen, red dots appear across the map. These individual dots can be interacted with as a simple click provides the individual Klavern's name, exact location, group number, and a rough date of foundation. Users can get a grasp of of the expansion of the second Klan as a whole, or dive deeper into a specific group by clicking on individual pinpoints. Below is pictured an area of the U.S on the DH displaying what the pinpoints look like on a map. Each location is interactive.
